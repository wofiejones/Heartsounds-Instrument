Bill of Materials – At the moment, since the hardware is still being developed, there are no particular required purchases for the implementation of this product. 


Implementation Details:

Gestures: Pressing the various buttons to trigger sounds, and using a touchscreen (touch) device trigger sound effects. 
Sensors: I chose to use a touch screen with the phone because it is very easily accessible to most people since they have a phone and is very easily intuitive. I also chose touch by pushing buttons because this is also a device meant to help relieve stress, and I feel that touch helps allow an easily initiative way to play music for this intention. 
Data processing: The main data processing is through the use of Max by Cycling ‘74.
What was successful and what was unsuccessful.
I’m still working through integration aspects especially for the hardware, so that is the biggest working progress for me at this moment. 
Future plans for continuing the development of your project.
I would love to really work on the hardware for this device, because I would really love for it to be something people can use in a variety of different ways, including for meditation, yoga, stress relief, and music making. In order for this to be easily accessible to a variety of people, I would like to make this as easily intuitive and with the least amount of setup as possible as my main goal.
