Implementation Details:


Gestures: Pressing the various buttons to trigger sounds, and using a touchscreen (touch) device trigger sound effects. 

Sensors: I chose to use a touch screen with the phone because it is very easily accessible to most people since they have a phone and is very easily intuitive. I also chose touch by pushing buttons because this is also a device meant to help relieve stress, and I feel that touch helps allow an easily initiative way to play music for this intention. 

Data processing: The data processing is through the use of Max by Cycling ‘74, and Arduino IDE. 
What was successful and what was unsuccessful.
I was able to capture the gesture of triggering various buttons, but would still like to work on creating more variations in sounds through having a bank option to switch between different sets of sounds. 

Future plans for continuing the development of your project.
I would love to really work on the hardware for this device, because I would really love for it to be something people can use whenever that doesn’t have to be attached to a computer. Also working with different sensors that are more surface touching with your hand, and the actual hardware to look nice enough to sell to all types of people, being used in a variety of different ways, including for meditation, yoga, stress relief, and music making. In order for this to be easily accessible to a variety of people, I would like to make this as easily intuitive and with the least amount of setup as possible as my main goal.
