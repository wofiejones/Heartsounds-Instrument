Short Proposal:
What will (likely) be the name of your instrument?

Heartsounds

In a paragraph or two, tell me about your instrument and how you intend to implement it.
What it is: The instrument I plan to implement is a device that you can turn to for rebalance, to help calm your nervous system, and to be a musical outlet. Drawing inspiration from healing instruments such as Tibetan singing bowls, handpans, and Steel Tongue Drums, I plan for this instrument to be something people can turn to when feeling stressed, off balance in life, or simply want a musical outlet. The special thing about this instrument is that it allows for a variety of modes of expression and possibility through the use of a variety of sounds only possible through the use of electronics. Similar to the shape and size of a Steel Tongue Drum, it encompasses a variety of sounds within it, all consisting of healing and calming frequencies and vibrations that will literally calm down your nervous system as you play. Some of these sounds will include long drones (to which you can choose different notes), samples of Tibetan singing bowls, gongs, various affirmations/quotes of deep insight, and a variety of other sounds that will allow for interesting music making while soothing you at the same time. This instrument is easily portabile and accessible to all people of all musical capabilities.


How it works:  The gesture I plan to capture is by striking the surface of a pad with your finger. Having the shape of a dome, there will be many little pads (possibly force sensitive resistors?) each enabling a different sound. There will be one pad separate from the rest that once hit will allow for a change of sounds within the other main pads. So this will enable a variety of sounds to be produced within a small surface area, allowing for more creative freedom. 

Good outcome deliverable – Write a list of features of what you WILL achieve no matter what.

Loaded samples (of Tibetan singing bowls, gongs, various affirmations/quotes of deep insight)  triggered through striking a pad / sensor 
Max patch/ software complete for this basic triggering
Physical shape of instrument 

Better outcome deliverable – Expand your previously written list of features to include what you THINK you will accomplish before the project’s deadline.

Various synthesized sounds (can be very simple) using a 432 Hz tuning system.Loaded samples (of Tibetan singing bowls, gongs, various affirmations/quotes of deep insight)  triggered through striking a pad / sensor

Added visual component where visuals will match up and follow what the user is performing.

In a paragraph or two, outline your next steps and tell me what additional skills you will require and what topics you might research for the completion of this project.

Next steps:
1. Build max patch with loaded desired samples 
2. Connect built max patch to a sensor to physically trigger samples
3. Make this basic process easy and fun to play (through adding more sensors, adjusting things as necessary.) **Aim here is to make a complete instrument with just samples. 
4. Work on physical design of instrument 
5. Add to your current instrument by building a max patch that uses a 432 Hz tuning system for long held drones. (can start with simplified version to start)
6. Incorporate the new added sounds to be able to play physically in a fun way with sensors. **Focus on being able to switch easily between the sampled sounds and the drone. 
7. (if time): Add visuals to be projected on a separate device that responds to sounds created from instrument. 
I feel that this instrument is fairly simple and attainable for me within the time I have to make it. I will need to continue to study and learn a lot about using Max, and how to create my desired patches in it. If I have time to add the visual component, I will need to research various simple ways to make this possible.
